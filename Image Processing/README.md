# Image Processing #

Various image processing algorithms and techniques.

* [Image Segmentation K-Nearest Neighbour:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/Processing/tree/master/Image%20Processing/ImageSegmentationKNN) Image segmentation using the k-nearest neighbour algorithm.
* [Floyd-Steinberg Dithering:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/Processing/tree/master/Image%20Processing/FloydSteinbergDithering) A dithering technique using error diffusion, meaning it pushes the residual quantisation error of a pixel onto its neighbouring pixels, to be dealt with later.
* [Image Thresholding:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/Processing/tree/master/Image%20Processing/ImageThresholding) Thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation.
* [Image Dot Screen:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/Processing/tree/master/Image%20Processing/ImageDotScreen) A simple form of resolution reduction by increasing the effective pixel size.
* [Image Voronoi:](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/Processing/tree/master/Image%20Processing/ImageVoronoi) Using the k-nearest neighbour algorithm to break an image up into Voronoi colour fields.
