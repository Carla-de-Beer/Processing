Processing
==========

This repository contains .pde code for Processing sketches (refer http://processing.org/ for more information on Processing).

These sketches are examples that have been developed over the years. Most make use of nature-inspired phenomena or mathematics, such as autonomous agents and cellular automata. Some of the older sketches were developed in Processing 2, or less, and may require some adjustment where they are to be run in Processing 3.
